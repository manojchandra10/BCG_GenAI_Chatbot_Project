# BCG GenAI Job Simulation on Forage - April 2024
In this Project, As a junior data scientist at BCG's GenAI Consulting team, I'm developing an AI-powered chatbot for a leading global financial institution, Global Finance Corp.

My goal is to leverage these insights for strategic client recommendations.
